space simulator based on Begin for DOS and Windows
This is based of the work of Nels Anderson and Tom Nelson and I in no way take credit for their game design and concepts.
However their game is open to public for download and without charge and there is no support or future releases expected,
therefore as a Python exercise I am taking up the challenge to do a remake of their game and add some features and strategies. 
I have played lots of space games and their simple CLI style game is by far my favorite Star Trek game ever made - and I've played a lot of them.
